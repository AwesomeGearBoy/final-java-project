# FINAL JAVA PROJECT!

The program is pretty self explainatory, so I am not going to create a whole README, mostly because I'm a programmer, and I'm lazy. But Kruski, if you're reading this, you might want to know what the admin password is for the program without trying to decipher what it is.

***THIS DOESN'T COUNT AS AN UNENCRYPTED PASSWORD BECAUSE YOU NEED IT TO TEST IT!***

The admin password is literally just `admin123`. Go nuts.
